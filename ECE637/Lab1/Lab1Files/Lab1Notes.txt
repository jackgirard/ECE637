Lab 1 Notes
created conda environment (using Anaconda Prompt) - not sure why it wasn't working using the standard command prompt?
once .yml was downloaded and within it as working directory: called conda env create -f environment.yml
To activate environment: conda activate NAME
To deactivate environment: conda deactivate

Need to become more familiar with Python syntax
Where can you access files in Jupyter from? What directory on the computer has those files?
What if I wanted to upload to GitHub or sync with a different repository on my computer?

Image manipulation is centered around reading in, manipulating, and reading out an image file. Main function for manipulation is
convolution. Is this convolution the convolution of the individual frequencies or rgb colors from the image? Need to clarify

General note: If code is not understood, write it out line by line and take note as to what each line does. Also, get a blank piece
of paper and just write down the memory addresses of all variables in the script, and this may help with understanding pointers.

Pointer question:
consider:
int x = 5:
int* y = &x;
value of x: 5
value of y: memory address of x
what happens if you say:
int* y = x? This is not valid correct?
What if you say:
int* y = 10, just assign it to an integer
Even though a pointer wouldn't be required in this case, is this still valid?? This is what the example is doing

- walk back through with Thomas the steps for setting up a project in C, particularly, where is Demo.sh executed??
